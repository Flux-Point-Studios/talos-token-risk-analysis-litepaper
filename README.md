# Talos Token Risk Analysis Litepaper

## 1. Introduction
**Talos Token Risk Analysis** is an AI-driven platform that provides comprehensive, real-time risk analysis and insights into Cardano-based tokens. By aggregating on-chain data from TapTools, risk profiles from Xerberus, and social sentiment from Twitter (X.com), we deliver a synthesized, actionable report that helps investors, issuers, and analysts make informed decisions.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Lack of Consolidated Token Data
- **On-chain Complexity**: There is a wide variety of on-chain data—such as price, market cap, and liquidity metrics—spread out over multiple platforms. This fragmentation can slow down informed decision-making.
- **Risk Profiles**: Many risk indicators exist (e.g., fundamental risk factors, liquidity, code vulnerability), but they are scattered and difficult to interpret.
- **Sentiment Data**: Social media sentiment can significantly influence token performance. However, it is often cumbersome to aggregate and interpret these signals in tandem with on-chain metrics.

### 2.2 Inefficient Manual Analysis
- **Limited Accessibility**: Typically, analysts need specialized tools and significant domain knowledge to interpret on-chain data and risk factors, creating high barriers to entry for new or less technical users.
- **Time-Consuming**: Manually collecting and cross-referencing various sources of data (on-chain metrics, risk rating services, social sentiment) can be both tedious and error-prone.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

### 3.1 AI-Driven Risk Analysis
- **Talos AI Agent**: Our proprietary AI engine, Talos, uses machine learning to ingest and interpret data from multiple sources. It looks for patterns, anomalies, and correlations that might signal risk or opportunity.
- **Aggregated Data Pipeline**: Our platform automatically fetches:
  - **TapTools** (on-chain data): Price, market cap, 24h volume  
  - **Xerberus** (risk rating): Overall risk category, security ratings  
  - **Social Sentiment** (Twitter/X): Real-time mentions, sentiment trending  
- **Comprehensive Report**: Talos synthesizes all of the above into a single, easy-to-read JSON response with deep insights.

### 3.2 Technical Architecture
1. **Data Ingestion**:  
   - **TapTools API** for Cardano’s on-chain metrics  
   - **Xerberus API** for risk ratings  
   - **Twitter/X API** for social sentiment  
2. **Analysis Layer**:  
   - **Talos** AI model that processes input data and produces a combined risk profile and directional assessment.  
3. **Output**:  
   - RESTful API endpoint (`POST /analyze-token`) returns a full analysis report in JSON, including commentary on price trends, market structure, risk level, and social buzz.

1. **Basic cURL Request**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://talos-token-risk-analysis.vercel.app/analyze-token" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
        -d '{"tokenName": "SNEK", "policyId": "279c909f348e533da5808898f87f9a14..."}'
   ```
2. **In-app Integration**
   - *Developers* can integrate this into their existing trading or wallet application to provide real-time risk metrics.  
   - *Analysts* can automate token scanning and store historical outputs for further quant analysis.

## 8. TapTools Endpoint Integration

Talos leverages the [TapTools](https://openapi.taptools.io/) API to obtain robust on-chain metrics specific to Cardano-based tokens. These metrics form the backbone of Talos’s risk analysis, combining with social sentiment (Twitter/X) and Xerberus’s risk scores to create a holistic token report.

### Why TapTools?
- **Comprehensive On-Chain Metrics**: Real-time price, market cap, volume, and more.
- **Straightforward Endpoints**: Simple REST calls return structured JSON data.
- **AI-Ready Data**: Consolidated metrics help Talos quickly gauge a token’s liquidity, ownership distribution, trading trends, and volatility.

### Endpoints & Their Role in Talos Analysis
1. **`/token/mcap` (`fetchTokenMcap`)**  
   - **Purpose**: Retrieves the current market cap.  
   - **Influence**: High market cap can indicate lower volatility; extremely low market cap often signals higher risk.

2. **`/token/ohlcv` (`fetchTokenOHLCV`)**  
   - **Purpose**: Provides Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume over a specified interval.  
   - **Influence**: Identifies price trends and volume surges, feeding into Talos’s bullish/bearish momentum analysis.

3. **`/token/holders` & `/token/holders/top` (`fetchTokenHolders`, `fetchTokenTopHolders`)**  
   - **Purpose**: Shows total holders and distribution among top holders.  
   - **Influence**: A more decentralized token distribution typically reduces manipulation risk, which lowers Talos’s overall risk score.

4. **`/token/indicators` (`fetchTokenIndicators`)**  
   - **Purpose**: Fetches technical indicators (EMA, RSI, MACD, etc.).  
   - **Influence**: Helps Talos gauge short- and long-term momentum. Overbought/oversold signals feed into risk assessment.

5. **`/token/pools` (`fetchTokenPools`)**  
   - **Purpose**: Details active liquidity pools on Cardano DEXes.  
   - **Influence**: Sufficient liquidity across multiple pools indicates better trading conditions and lower risk of slippage/manipulation.

6. **`/token/prices/chg` (`fetchTokenPriceChange`)**  
   - **Purpose**: Displays price change percentages over various timeframes (1h, 4h, 24h, etc.).  
   - **Influence**: Rapid or extreme price movements raise risk flags, especially if accompanied by low liquidity or negative social sentiment.

7. **`/token/quote` (`fetchTokenQuote`)**  
   - **Purpose**: Retrieves real-time quotes in specified currencies (e.g., USD, BTC).  
   - **Influence**: Normalizes performance data across different quotes, useful for multi-currency portfolios.

8. **`/token/trading/stats` (`fetchTokenTradingStats`)**  
   - **Purpose**: Aggregates buy/sell volume, number of buyers/sellers, and more within a timeframe.  
   - **Influence**: Sudden spikes in sell volume or lopsided buyer/seller ratios can signal heightened short-term volatility.

9. **`/token/links` (`fetchTokenLinks`)**  
   - **Purpose**: Retrieves official sites and social media links (website, Twitter, etc.).  
   - **Influence**: Allows Talos to cross-check official social channels with real-time sentiment data, enriching the final analysis.

### Caching for Performance
We employ a Redis-based caching layer to:
- **Reduce Latency**: Avoid repeated requests to TapTools for popular tokens.  
- **Enhance Stability**: Minimize the risk of hitting TapTools rate limits and keep Talos responsive.  

### Putting It All Together
By combining TapTools’ granular on-chain data with other risk signals, Talos delivers a unified, AI-powered score and analysis for Cardano tokens. This approach simplifies due diligence for traders, analysts, and developers wanting to integrate risk analytics directly into their applications.
